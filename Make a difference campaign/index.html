<h2> What is HM Debate? </h2>
<p> 
The Horace Mann Debate Team, one of the largest clubs in our school, has over 100 members and competes in Public Forum Debate tournaments at schools and universities throughout the nation such as Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Princeton.  Not only is debate fun and intriguing, but it also expands your knowledge on current events and global affairs and develops critical academic skills such as researching skills, public speaking skills and writing. HM Debate meets during I period once or twice a week and hosts tournaments on weekends.

<h2> Mission </h2>
<p>
Our mission is to spread the concept of debate in the Horace Mann community because debate is an invaluable experience that we would love to share with the HM student body. We aim to make debate an enjoyable thing for everyone.
