<h2>What is Public Forum Debate?</h2>
<p>
Public Forum Debate &#40;sometimes abbreviated as PFD&#41; is a style of Debate that is used in debate competitions throughout the United States. It is the format of debate used by the HM Debate Team. All of the competitions that we attend will be of the Public Forum Debate format. In PFD, there is a central topic, called the resolution, that both teams will have to conform to during their debate. Both teams will also have equal amounts of time to make their case, provide counter-arguments, and ask questions. The format of PFD can vary because different debate institutions might have different guidelines, so here's a sample of the format used by HM Debate&#58;
</p>
<br>
<h2>Public Forum Debate format&#58;</h2>
<p>
<strong>Constructive Speech&#58;</strong> The constructive speech is the first speech of the Debate round and lasts 4 minutes. In this speech, each team introduces their main arguments, which are broken down into contentions.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Rebuttal&#58;</strong> The Rebuttal speeches, which last for 4 minutes, respond to the constructive speeches and present additional counter-arguments that target the evidence, analysis or logic of each opposing argument. The Rebuttal can address both general themes in a debate or attack specific, nuanced aspects of the round. 
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Summary&#58;</strong> The summary speech, one of the most important speeches of a debate round, focuses the round on the main voting issues and lasts 2 minutes. In the summary, the speaker condenses the arguments, responds to arguments made in the rebuttals and explains to the judge why his or her side is winning the round.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Cross Fire&#58;</strong> Cross Fire, which lasts for 3 minutes and occurs after the Constructive, Rebuttal and Summary, is an opportunity for opponents to ask each other questions about their arguments.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Final Focus&#58;</strong> The Final Focus is the last speech of the round and lasts 2 minutes. In the final focus the speaker explains why his or her side has won the round and also weighs which argument that was made is most important.
