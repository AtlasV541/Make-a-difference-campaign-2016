<h2>What is HM Debate?</h2>
<p>
The HM Debate team is one of the largest student-run organizations at Horace Mann School, with well over 100 members. HM Debate is the school&#39;s only classic debate organization&#59; members are split up into teams of two and debate about topics &#34;ripped from the headlines&#34; in tournaments both within and beyond the New York City area against debaters from across the country. We have a wide assortment of debaters with different levels of experience&#59; some are casual or new-timers, and others are dedicated debaters who compete in &#40;and win&#41; competitions hosted by the nation&#39;s top schools and universities. 
Debate provides a style of competition that is unique to itself. It draws over 130,000 students annually from the best public and private schools across the United States to form the country&#39;s largest academic competition. More importantly though, debate will present to you an opportunity to understand matters of national and international importance in great depth and detail. Not only that, debate will also strengthen your critical writing, speaking, and thinking skills. Furthermore, debate is also a great way to make new friends, meet new people, and learn to win arguments with friends, parents, and teachers alike. 
HM Debate meets during I period either once or twice a week. We offer and host out-of-school tournaments based on our members&#39; interest and commitment. The tournaments that we participate in are usually held on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and&#47;or Sundays. 
Even though we meet far more often and attend many competitions than other clubs, we still strive to help interested students in finding a competition schedule and level of commitment that best suits their schedule. We don&#39;t require a specific debate skill level from any of our debaters&#59; anyone who is interested is more than welcome to join the HM Debate team.

<h2> Our Mission: </h2>
<p>
The mission of HM Debate is to spread the love of debate in the Horace Mann community because debate is an invaluable experience that we would love to share with the HM student community. We aim to make debate an enjoyable thing for everyone. Additionally, we aim to improve students&#39; critical academic skills, such as researching, organizing information, writing, thinking, and public speaking. Many people believe that HM Debate is only for experienced and highly competive debaters, but we accept debaters of any skill level, no matter what. Our only requirement is that you have an interest in debate that we can help you pursue.
