<h2> What is the Horace Mann Debate Team? </h2>
<p> 
The Horace Mann Debate Team, one of the largest clubs in our school, has over 100 members and competes in Public Forum Debate tournaments at schools and universities throughout the nation such as Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Princeton.  Not only is debate fun and intriguing, but it also expands your knowledge on current events and global affairs and develops critical academic skills such as researching skills, public speaking skills and writing. We meet I periods once or twice a week and host tournaments on weekends.
