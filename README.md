# Make a difference campaign 2016
This is the project repository for the ICS 1st trimester final project (Make a difference campaign). For this project, we will be talking about the Debate team. The debate team is one of the largest organizations at school, and has competed in many tournaments across the nation. With well over 100 members, we have competed at many prestigious unversities across the United States. 
Not only is debate fun and intriguing, but it also expands your knowledge on current events and global affairs and develops critical academic skills such as researching skills, public speaking skills and writing.
